# Utils

Implementations for some of the [GNU Core Utilities](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/coreutils.html) in C.

**WARNING**: Keep in mind that none of those tools are trying to have all the features that the "original" has. I only do this in my free time when i bored.

## Quick Start
```console
$ make
$ ./bin/<tool>
```
